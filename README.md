## Tests
in the "Test" folder you can find all tests. The server is tested by using [locust](https://locust.io/). In the "TestServer" folder there is a file called [requirements.txt](Test/TestServer/requirements.txt) this is used to add all things the python server needs to import. So if some new libary is used in the server.py file remember to update the [requirements.txt](Test/TestServer/requirements.txt).
